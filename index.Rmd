The ice record at Lake Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, is the oldest known human-observed climate record in the world, ice formation dates from 1443

Omiwatari or ice ridges form on the lake as pressure ridges that arise due to vertical thermal temperature gradients in the lake

Local Shinto tradition holds that these Omiwatari &mdash; or God's Crossing &mdash; are formed by God's crossing Lake Suwa to move between the buildings of the Suwa Grand Shrine

Folklore has it that the Omiwatari are formed when the Guardian God of Suwa, Takeminakata-no-kami, leaves his sanctuary to visit his wife the goddess Yasakotame

# Trends in lake ice phenology

Magnuson *et al* (2000) &mdash, seminal study of trends in lake ice phenology

Confirmed by multiple follow-up studies

Long-term records of lake ice phenology demonstrated that many Northern Hemisphere lakes experienced earlier ice breakup, later ice freeze-up, and shorter ice duration within a warming world

<br />

[Magnuson *et al* (2000) Science 289, 1743‚Äì1746](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5485.1743)

???

Magnuson et al. (2000) observed long-term changes in lake ice cover in 20 spatially and morphologically heterogeneous lakes from 1855 to 1995. These long-term records of lake ice phenology demonstrated that many Northern Hemisphere lakes experienced earlier ice breakup, later ice freeze-up, and shorter ice duration within a warming world

hazard rate is piece-wise constant within time intervals but we estimate it semi-parametrically

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basis functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

---

# Weight basis functions &#8680; spline

```{r basis-function-animation, results = 'hide'}
bfun_plt <- plot(bfuns) +
    geom_line(data = smooth, aes(x = x, y = spline),
              inherit.aes = FALSE, lwd = 1.5) +
    labs(x = 'x', y = 'f(x)') +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14, base_family = 'Fira Sans')

bfun_anim <- animate(
    bfun_plt + transition_states(draw, transition_length = 4, state_length = 2) + 
    ease_aes('cubic-in-out'),
    nframes = 200, height = anim_height, width = anim_width, res = anim_res, dev = anim_dev)

anim_save('resources/basis-fun-anim.gif', bfun_anim)
```

But if we choose different weights we get more wiggly spline

Each of the splines I showed you earlier are all generated from the same basis functions but using different weights

Fitting a GAM involves finding the weights for the basis functions that produce a spline that fits the data best, subject to some constraints
